## Overview
#### Motivation
Get in touch with Hack Fridays, coding and soldering.
Connect Semaphore (or any other deploy API) with visual LEDs to show deploy process status in real time, for a number of repositories.

#### Scope
Create a "simple" integration between Semaphore's API and multiple LED strips.

There needs to be an admin interface where one can assign a specific LED strip, to a speficic repo. Ideally, each repo would have two different LED stips, one for deploy status and another to monitor the uptime.

#### Estimation
6 Days
